Here we report the earliest evidence of lethal interpersonal violence in the hominin fossil record. Cranium 17 recovered from the Sima de los Huesos Middle Pleistocene site shows two clear perimortem depression fractures on the frontal bone, interpreted as being produced by two episodes of localized blunt force trauma. The type of injuries, their location, the strong similarity of the fractures in shape and size, and the different orientations and implied trajectories of the two fractures suggest they were produced with the same object in face-to-face interpersonal conflict. Given that either of the two traumatic events was likely lethal, the presence of multiple blows implies an intention to kill. This finding shows that the lethal interpersonal violence is an ancient human behavior and has important implications for the accumulation of bodies at the site, supporting an anthropic origin.","context":{"all":{"count":3835537,"mean":5.0344244960863,"rank":525,"pct":99,"higher_than":3835276},"journal":{"count":68078,"mean":8.282921985399,"rank":24,"pct":99,"higher_than":68055},"similar_age_3m":{"count":69242,"mean":7.9288712756893,"rank":30,"pct":99,"higher_than":69212},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":2902,"mean":7.0076504653568,"rank":2,"pct":99,"higher_than":2900}},"altmetric_id":4064154,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":1,"cited_by_feeds_count":8,"cited_by_msm_count":64,"cited_by_posts_count":331,"cited_by_rdts_count":2,"cited_by_tweeters_count":237,"cited_by_accounts_count":312,"last_updated":1433339934,"score":754.66,"history":{"1d":1.75,"2d":34.1,"3d":38.95,"4d":54.55,"5d":107.784,"6d":290.934,"1w":744.66,"1m":754.66,"3m":754.66,"6m":754.66,"1y":754.66,"at":754.66},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0126589","added_on":1432750710,"published_on":1432710000,"subjects":["science","medicine"],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"readers":{"citeulike":0,"mendeley":0,"connotea":0},"readers_count":0,"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=755&types=mbttttrf","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=755&types=mbttttrf","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=755&types=mbttttrf"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4064154"},{"title":"Robotics: Ethics of artificial intelligence","doi":"10.1038/521415a","pmid":"26017428","nlmid":"0410462","tq":["From autonomous drones to automated drug prescription -- four researchers on the ethics of AI","Most popular now: From autonomous drones to automated drug prescription -- the ethics of AI","Leading researchers share concerns solutions for reducing risks from artificial intelligence","Ethics of artificial intelligence #AI"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003160","issns":["1476-4687"],"journal":"Nature","cohorts":{"pub":692,"sci":83,"com":39,"doc":9},"context":{"all":{"count":3836636,"mean":5.0351199225417,"rank":542,"pct":99,"higher_than":3836357},"journal":{"count":35516,"mean":43.618212586231,"rank":180,"pct":99,"higher_than":35336},"similar_age_3m":{"count":69578,"mean":7.9339661094903,"rank":31,"pct":99,"higher_than":69547},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":550,"mean":139.92687795993,"rank":15,"pct":97,"higher_than":535}},"altmetric_id":4063915,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"cited_by_fbwalls_count":4,"cited_by_feeds_count":3,"cited_by_gplus_count":16,"cited_by_msm_count":8,"cited_by_posts_count":1107,"cited_by_rdts_count":9,"cited_by_tweeters_count":823,"cited_by_accounts_count":863,"last_updated":1433354086,"score":744.614,"history":{"1d":37.39,"2d":84.64,"3d":182.19,"4d":207.49,"5d":256.464,"6d":395.364,"1w":728.514,"1m":744.614,"3m":744.614,"6m":744.614,"1y":744.614,"at":744.614},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/521415a","added_on":1432746984,"published_on":1432771200,"subjects":["science"],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"readers":{"citeulike":0,"mendeley":0,"connotea":0},"readers_count":0,"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=745&types=mbtttrfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=745&types=mbtttrfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=745&types=mbtttrfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4063915"},{"title":"New species from Ethiopia further expands Middle Pliocene hominin diversity","doi":"10.1038/nature14448","pmid":"26017448","nlmid":"0410462","tq":["A new hominin species that lived at the same time as the famous ‘Lucy’ in Ethiopia between 3.3 and 3.5m years ago","Another Lucy? #NSFfunded researcher led team that found new human ancestor species in Ethiopia.","I wonder if Nature would publish New species from Ethiopia further expands Middle Pliocene lepidopteran diversity","Exciting news of the discovery of a new human ancestor species - Australopithecus deyiremeda! partly #NSFfunded"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003160","issns":["0028-0836","1476-4687"],"journal":"Nature","cohorts":{"pub":199,"sci":62,"com":18,"doc":7},"abstract":"Middle Pliocene hominin species diversity has been a subject of debate over the past two decades, particularly after the naming of Australopithecus bahrelghazali and Kenyanthropus platyops in addition to the well-known species Australopithecus afarensis. Further analyses continue to support the proposal that several hominin species co-existed during this time period. Here we recognize a new hominin species (Australopithecus deyiremeda sp. nov.) from 3.3-3.5-million-year-old deposits in the Woranso-Mille study area, central Afar, Ethiopia. The new species from Woranso-Mille shows that there were at least two contemporaneous hominin species living in the Afar region of Ethiopia between 3.3 and 3.5 million years ago, and further confirms early hominin taxonomic diversity in eastern Africa during the Middle Pliocene epoch. The morphology of Au. deyiremeda also reinforces concerns related to dentognathic (that is, jaws and teeth) homoplasy in Plio-Pleistocene hominins, and shows that some dentognathic features traditionally associated with Paranthropus and Homo appeared in the fossil record earlier than previously thought.","context":{"all":{"count":3835817,"mean":5.0345661538564,"rank":696,"pct":99,"higher_than":3835211},"journal":{"count":35480,"mean":43.639098452606,"rank":240,"pct":99,"higher_than":35240},"similar_age_3m":{"count":69272,"mean":7.9325153671811,"rank":35,"pct":99,"higher_than":69237},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":520,"mean":147.75004238921,"rank":19,"pct":96,"higher_than":501}},"altmetric_id":4063934,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological anthropology","scheme":"npg"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":2,"cited_by_feeds_count":12,"cited_by_msm_count":46,"cited_by_posts_count":363,"cited_by_rdts_count":6,"cited_by_tweeters_count":286,"cited_by_accounts_count":352,"last_updated":1433342250,"score":661.988,"history":{"1d":2,"2d":23.1,"3d":30.45,"4d":56.324,"5d":70.624,"6d":205.904,"1w":633.988,"1m":661.988,"3m":661.988,"6m":661.988,"1y":661.988,"at":661.988},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature14448","added_on":1432747255,"published_on":1432684800,"subjects":["science"],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"readers":{"citeulike":3,"mendeley":0,"connotea":0},"readers_count":3,"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=662&types=mbttttrf","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=662&types=mbttttrf","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=662&types=mbttttrf"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4063934"},{"title":"Robots that can adapt like animals","doi":"10.1038/nature14422","pmid":"26017452","nlmid":"0410462","tq":["A machine-learning algorithm that allows damaged robots quickly to regain their ability to perform tasks","Our new paper is online.

They are also invaluable tools for scientific exploration in environments inaccessible to humans, from distant planets to deep oceans. A major obstacle to their widespread adoption in more complex environments outside factories is their fragility. Whereas animals can quickly adapt to injuries, current robots cannot 'think outside the box' to find a compensatory behaviour when they are damaged: they are limited to their pre-specified self-sensing abilities, can diagnose only anticipated failure modes, and require a pre-programmed contingency plan for every type of potential damage, an impracticality for complex robots. A promising approach to reducing robot fragility involves having robots learn appropriate behaviours in response to damage, but current techniques are slow even with small, constrained search spaces. Here we introduce an intelligent trial-and-error algorithm that allows robots to adapt to damage in less than two minutes in large search spaces without requiring self-diagnosis or pre-specified contingency plans. Before the robot is deployed, it uses a novel technique to create a detailed map of the space of high-performing behaviours. This map represents the robot's prior knowledge about what behaviours it can perform and their value. When the robot is damaged, it uses this prior knowledge to guide a trial-and-error learning algorithm that conducts intelligent experiments to rapidly discover a behaviour that compensates for the damage. Experiments reveal successful adaptations for a legged robot injured in five different ways, including damaged, broken, and missing legs, and for a robotic arm with joints broken in 14 different ways. This new algorithm will enable more robust, effective, autonomous robots, and may shed light on the principles that animals use to adapt to injury.","context":{"all":{"count":3833961,"mean":5.0337173280401,"rank":784,"pct":99,"higher_than":3833039},"journal":{"count":35474,"mean":43.680593256653,"rank":262,"pct":99,"higher_than":35211},"similar_age_3m":{"count":68867,"mean":7.8911786559773,"rank":39,"pct":99,"higher_than":68815},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":520,"mean":147.49892870906,"rank":21,"pct":95,"higher_than":499}},"altmetric_id":4063935,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Computer science","scheme":"npg"}],"cited_by_feeds_count":9,"cited_by_gplus_count":8,"cited_by_msm_count":33,"cited_by_posts_count":492,"cited_by_rdts_count":2,"cited_by_tweeters_count":434,"cited_by_accounts_count":486,"last_updated":1433325519,"score":627.484,"history":{"1d":5.85,"2d":41.6,"3d":83.15,"4d":182.322,"5d":215.222,"6d":291.822,"1w":607.484,"1m":627.484,"3m":627.484,"6m":627.484,"1y":627.484,"at":627.484},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature14422","added_on":1432747261,"published_on":1432684800,"subjects":["science"],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"readers":{"citeulike":3,"mendeley":0,"connotea":0},"readers_count":3,"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=628&types=mbttttrg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=628&types=mbttttrg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=628&types=mbttttrg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4063935"},{"title":"The Global Burden of Cancer 2013","doi":"10.1001/jamaoncol.2015.0735","tq":["Age-Specific Contributions of Cancer Types to Global Cancer Incidence Mortality #ASCO15","Age-standardized #cancer death rates decreased in 126 of 188 countries from 1990-2013 #ASCO15","Estimated #global #burden of #cancer = 14.9M new cases, 8.2M deaths 196.3M years of healthy life lost in 2013.","Tracheal-bronchus-lung cancer most common cause of #cancer death globally #ASCO15"],"altmetric_jid":"54d8989b2a83eea31c8b4567","journal":"JAMA Oncology","cohorts":{"doc":111,"pub":435,"sci":92,"com":18},"context":{"all":{"count":3836919,"mean":5.0351600070736,"rank":1157,"pct":99,"higher_than":3835893},"journal":{"count":115,"mean":56.958035087719,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":114},"similar_age_3m":{"count":69151,"mean":7.951322516269,"rank":63,"pct":99,"higher_than":69088},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":49,"mean":36.619791666667,"rank":1,"pct":97,"higher_than":48}},"altmetric_id":4067544,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"cited_by_fbwalls_count":1,"cited_by_gplus_count":2,"cited_by_msm_count":10,"cited_by_posts_count":852,"cited_by_tweeters_count":656,"cited_by_accounts_count":669,"last_updated":1433357036,"score":524.55,"history":{"1d":33.85,"2d":76.25,"3d":169,"4d":299.7,"5d":434.55,"6d":511.6,"1w":524.55,"1m":524.55,"3m":524.55,"6m":524.55,"1y":524.55,"at":524.55},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamaoncol.2015.0735","added_on":1432826685,"published_on":1432771200,"scopus_subjects":[],"readers":{"citeulike":0,"mendeley":0,"connotea":0},"readers_count":0,"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=525&types=mtttttfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=525&types=mtttttfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=525&types=mtttttfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4067544"},{"title":"New species of early human discovered near fossil of ‘Lucy’","doi":"10.1038/nature.2015.17644","nlmid":"0410462","tq":["Lucy's got neighbours!

Here, we investigated training to reduce implicit racial and gender bias. Forty participants processed counterstereotype information paired with one sound for each type of bias. Biases were reduced immediately after training. During subsequent slow-wave sleep, one sound was unobtrusively presented to each participant, repeatedly, to reactivate one type of training. Corresponding bias reductions were fortified in comparison with the social bias not externally reactivated during sleep. This advantage remained 1 week later, the magnitude of which was associated with time in slow-wave and rapid-eye-movement sleep after training. We conclude that memory reactivation during sleep enhances counterstereotype training and that maintaining a bias reduction is sleep-dependent.","context":{"all":{"count":3837088,"mean":5.0354099435381,"rank":2394,"pct":99,"higher_than":3834712},"journal":{"count":28405,"mean":21.98783002394,"rank":193,"pct":99,"higher_than":28212},"similar_age_3m":{"count":69179,"mean":7.9540967070456,"rank":120,"pct":99,"higher_than":69059},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":366,"mean":64.372180821918,"rank":11,"pct":96,"higher_than":355}},"altmetric_id":4068057,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"cited_by_fbwalls_count":1,"cited_by_feeds_count":4,"cited_by_gplus_count":1,"cited_by_msm_count":25,"cited_by_peer_review_sites_count":1,"cited_by_posts_count":233,"cited_by_rdts_count":1,"cited_by_tweeters_count":183,"cited_by_accounts_count":216,"last_updated":1433358420,"score":365.35,"history":{"1d":45.85,"2d":85.7,"3d":113.1,"4d":129.15,"5d":156.1,"6d":277.346,"1w":365.35,"1m":365.35,"3m":365.35,"6m":365.35,"1y":365.35,"at":365.35},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa3841","added_on":1432836732,"published_on":1432857600,"subjects":["science"],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"readers":{"citeulike":3,"mendeley":0,"connotea":0},"readers_count":3,"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=366&types=embttrfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=366&types=embttrfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=366&types=embttrfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4068057"},{"title":"Structural and functional features of central nervous system lymphatic vessels","doi":"10.1038/nature14432","pmid":"26030524","nlmid":"0410462","tq":["A lymphatic system is discovered in the brain - neurology finally meets immunology this is big.","Researchers discover direct link between brain and immune system","Did you catch the neat research finding in Nature #MECFS #Brilliant Brain/immune/Lymph vessels","Amazingly the brain is directly connected to the immune system by vessels previously thought not to exist."],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003160","issns":["1476-4687"],"journal":"Nature","cohorts":{"sci":66,"pub":222,"doc":26,"com":13},"abstract":"One of the characteristics of the central nervous system is the lack of a classical lymphatic drainage system. Although it is now accepted that the central nervous system undergoes constant immune surveillance that takes place within the meningeal compartment, the mechanisms governing the entrance and exit of immune cells from the central nervous system remain poorly understood. In searching for T-cell gateways into and out of the meninges, we discovered functional lymphatic vessels lining the dural sinuses. These structures express all of the molecular hallmarks of lymphatic endothelial cells, are able to carry both fluid and immune cells from the cerebrospinal fluid, and are connected to the deep cervical lymph nodes. The unique location of these vessels may have impeded their discovery to date, thereby contributing to the long-held concept of the absence of lymphatic vasculature in the central nervous system. The discovery of the central nervous system lymphatic system may call for a reassessment of basic assumptions in neuroimmunology and sheds new light on the aetiology of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases associated with immune system dysfunction.","context":{"all":{"count":3837088,"mean":5.0354099435381,"rank":2929,"pct":99,"higher_than":3834181},"journal":{"count":35518,"mean":43.63433077118,"rank":869,"pct":97,"higher_than":34649},"similar_age_3m":{"count":63898,"mean":7.6924940764042,"rank":123,"pct":99,"higher_than":63775},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":491,"mean":142.23136734694,"rank":55,"pct":88,"higher_than":436}},"altmetric_id":4078134,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neuroimmunology","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Lymphatic vessels","scheme":"npg"}],"cited_by_feeds_count":5,"cited_by_gplus_count":1,"cited_by_msm_count":8,"cited_by_posts_count":365,"cited_by_rdts_count":3,"cited_by_tweeters_count":327,"cited_by_accounts_count":344,"last_updated":1433358526,"score":331.43,"history":{"1d":211.73,"2d":310.08,"3d":331.43,"4d":331.43,"5d":331.43,"6d":331.43,"1w":331.43,"1m":331.43,"3m":331.43,"6m":331.43,"1y":331.43,"at":331.43},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature14432","added_on":1433171259,"published_on":1433116800,"subjects":["science"],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"readers":{"citeulike":0,"mendeley":0,"connotea":0},"readers_count":0,"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=332&types=mbttttrg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=332&types=mbttttrg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=332&types=mbttttrg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4078134"},{"title":"Antibiotic alternatives rev up bacterial arms race","doi":"10.1038/521402a","pmid":"26017421","nlmid":"0410462","tq":["Alligator peptides could kill drug-resistant bacteria.

It is unknown whether the process of memory consolidation occurs exclusively through the stabilization of memory engrams. By using learning-dependent cell labeling, we identified an increase of synaptic strength and dendritic spine density specifically in consolidated memory engram cells. Although these properties are lacking in engram cells under protein synthesis inhibitor-induced amnesia, direct optogenetic activation of these cells results in memory retrieval, and this correlates with retained engram cell-specific connectivity. We propose that a specific pattern of connectivity of engram cells may be crucial for memory information storage and that strengthened synapses in these cells critically contribute to the memory retrieval process.","context":{"all":{"count":3836349,"mean":5.0349038199926,"rank":4536,"pct":99,"higher_than":3832047},"journal":{"count":28404,"mean":21.977985987396,"rank":341,"pct":98,"higher_than":28064},"similar_age_3m":{"count":68976,"mean":7.9545766147155,"rank":224,"pct":99,"higher_than":68752},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":366,"mean":64.44397260274,"rank":21,"pct":94,"higher_than":345}},"altmetric_id":4068029,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"cited_by_feeds_count":5,"cited_by_msm_count":22,"cited_by_posts_count":161,"cited_by_rdts_count":1,"cited_by_tweeters_count":106,"cited_by_accounts_count":134,"last_updated":1433350117,"score":264.038,"history":{"1d":22.3,"2d":64.33,"3d":86.13,"4d":91.13,"5d":124.63,"6d":264.038,"1w":264.038,"1m":264.038,"3m":264.038,"6m":264.038,"1y":264.038,"at":264.038},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa5542","added_on":1432836459,"published_on":1432857600,"subjects":["science"],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"readers":{"citeulike":0,"mendeley":0,"connotea":0},"readers_count":0,"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=265&types=mbtttttr","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=265&types=mbtttttr","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=265&types=mbtttttr"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4068029"},{"title":"Science

Costly giving by adults has received considerable attention, but less is known about the possible benefits, as well as biological and environmental correlates, of altruism in early childhood. In the current study, we present evidence that children who forgo self-gain to help other people show greater vagal flexibility and higher subsequent vagal tone than children who do not, and children from less wealthy families behave more altruistically than those from wealthier families. These results suggest that (a) altruism should be viewed through a biopsychosocial lens, (b) the influence of privileged contexts on children's willingness to make personal sacrifices for others emerges early, and (c) altruism and healthy vagal functioning may share reciprocal relations in childhood. When children help others at a cost to themselves, they could be playing an active role in promoting their own well-being as well as the well-being of others.","context":{"all":{"count":3837088,"mean":5.0354099435381,"rank":5687,"pct":99,"higher_than":3831413},"journal":{"count":2034,"mean":40.112568617806,"rank":51,"pct":97,"higher_than":1983},"similar_age_3m":{"count":69667,"mean":7.9445609623059,"rank":277,"pct":99,"higher_than":69390},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":30,"mean":76.053724137931,"rank":3,"pct":90,"higher_than":27}},"altmetric_id":4061865,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_feeds_count":2,"cited_by_msm_count":2,"cited_by_posts_count":249,"cited_by_rdts_count":2,"cited_by_tweeters_count":241,"cited_by_accounts_count":247,"last_updated":1433358316,"score":231.642,"history":{"1d":193.542,"2d":229.892,"3d":230.892,"4d":230.892,"5d":230.892,"6d":231.142,"1w":231.142,"1m":231.642,"3m":231.642,"6m":231.642,"1y":231.642,"at":231.642},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0956797615578476","added_on":1432718958,"published_on":1432850429,"subjects":["psychology"],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Psychology"],"readers":{"citeulike":0,"mendeley":0,"connotea":0},"readers_count":0,"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=232&types=mbtttttr","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=232&types=mbtttttr","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=232&types=mbtttttr"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4061865"},{"title":"Ultralow-fatigue shape memory alloy films","doi":"10.1126/science.1261164","pmid":"26023135","nlmid":"0404511","tq":["New shape-memory alloys can get bent out of shape 10 million times before they wear out","This would make one heck of a bouncy ball?

We report on the discovery of an ultralow-fatigue shape memory alloy film system based on TiNiCu that allows at least 10 million transformation cycles.

These consumer electronics are frequently upgraded or discarded, leading to serious environmental contamination. Thus, electronic systems consisting of renewable and biodegradable materials and minimal amount of potentially toxic materials are desirable. Here we report high-performance flexible microwave and digital electronics that consume the smallest amount of potentially toxic materials on biobased, biodegradable and flexible cellulose nanofibril papers. Furthermore, we demonstrate gallium arsenide microwave devices, the consumer wireless workhorse, in a transferrable thin-film form. Successful fabrication of key electrical components on the flexible cellulose nanofibril paper with comparable performance to their rigid counterparts and clear demonstration of fungal biodegradation of the cellulose-nanofibril-based electronics suggest that it is feasible to fabricate high-performance flexible electronics using ecofriendly

To date, most studies have focused on the overall lifetime prevalence of any of these psychotic experiences (PEs), which might mask important features related to the types and frequencies of PEs.\nTo explore detailed epidemiologic information about PEs in a large multinational sample.\nWe obtained data from the World Health Organization World Mental Health Surveys, a coordinated set of community epidemiologic surveys of the prevalence and correlates of mental disorders in representative household samples from 18 countries throughout the world, from 2001 through 2009. Respondents included 31 261 adults (18 years and older) who were asked about lifetime and 12-month prevalence and frequency of 6 types of PEs (2 hallucinatory experiences and 4 delusional experiences). We analyzed the data from March 2014 through January 2015.\nPrevalence, frequency, and correlates of PEs.\nMean lifetime prevalence (SE) of ever having a PE was 5.8% (0.2%), with hallucinatory experiences (5.2% [0.2%]) much more common than delusional experiences (1.3% [0.1%]). More than two-thirds (72.0%) of respondents with lifetime PEs reported experiencing only 1 type. Psychotic experiences were typically infrequent, with 32.2% of respondents with lifetime PEs reporting only 1 occurrence and 31.8% reporting only 2 to 5 occurrences. We found a significant relationship between having more than 1 type of PE and having more frequent PE episodes (Cochran-Armitage z = -10.0; P < .001). Lifetime prevalence estimates (SEs) were significantly higher among respondents in middle- and high-income countries than among those in low-income countries (7.2% [0.4%], 6.8% [0.3%], and 3.2% [0.3%], respectively; χ22 range, 7.1-58.2; P < .001 for each) and among women than among men (6.6% [0.2%] vs 5.0% [0.3%]; χ21 = 16.0; P < .001). We found significant associations with lifetime prevalence of PEs in the multivariate model among nonmarried compared with married respondents (χ22 = 23.2; P < .001) and among respondents who were not employed (χ24 = 10.6; P < .001) and who had low family incomes (χ23 = 16.9; P < .001).\nThe epidemiologic features of PEs are more nuanced than previously thought. Research is needed that focuses on similarities and differences in the predictors of the onset, course, and consequences of distinct PEs.","context":{"all":{"count":3836919,"mean":5.0351600070736,"rank":7134,"pct":99,"higher_than":3829884},"journal":{"count":562,"mean":35.183518716578,"rank":16,"pct":97,"higher_than":546},"similar_age_3m":{"count":69628,"mean":7.9430320708921,"rank":330,"pct":99,"higher_than":69298},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":34,"mean":20.055636363636,"rank":1,"pct":97,"higher_than":33}},"altmetric_id":4063602,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"cited_by_feeds_count":4,"cited_by_gplus_count":1,"cited_by_msm_count":10,"cited_by_posts_count":199,"cited_by_tweeters_count":144,"cited_by_accounts_count":159,"last_updated":1433356249,"score":201.618,"history":{"1d":16.778,"2d":20.728,"3d":36.234,"4d":43.834,"5d":49.884,"6d":92.534,"1w":190.468,"1m":201.618,"3m":201.618,"6m":201.618,"1y":201.618,"at":201.618},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.0575","added_on":1432741445,"published_on":1432684800,"subjects":["psychiatry"],"scopus_subjects":[],"readers":{"citeulike":0,"mendeley":0,"connotea":0},"readers_count":0,"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=202&types=mbtttttg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=202&types=mbtttttg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=202&types=mbtttttg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4063602"},{"title":"Cognitive capacities for cooking in chimpanzees","doi":"10.1098/rspb.2015.0229","nlmid":"101245157","tq":["Do chimpanzees have the basic cognitive capacities for cooking?!

In particular, considerable evidence suggests that exposure to food marketing promotes eating habits that contribute to obesity. The present study examines neural responses to dynamic food commercials in overweight and healthy-weight adolescents using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Compared with non-food commercials, food commercials more strongly engaged regions involved in attention and saliency detection (occipital lobe, precuneus, superior temporal gyri, and right insula) and in processing rewards [left and right nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)]. Activity in the left OFC and right insula further correlated with subjects' percent body fat at the time of the scan. Interestingly, this reward-related activity to food commercials was accompanied by the additional recruitment of mouth-specific somatosensory-motor cortices-a finding that suggests the intriguing possibility that higher-adiposity adolescents mentally simulate eating behaviors and offers a potential neural mechanism for the formation and reinforcement of unhealthy eating habits that may hamper an individual's ability lose weight later in life.","context":{"all":{"count":3836636,"mean":5.0351199225417,"rank":5270,"pct":99,"higher_than":3831629},"journal":{"count":1614,"mean":6.3395164290143,"rank":2,"pct":99,"higher_than":1612},"similar_age_3m":{"count":76579,"mean":8.2574120765756,"rank":310,"pct":99,"higher_than":76269},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":25,"mean":8.4845,"rank":1,"pct":96,"higher_than":24}},"altmetric_id":4038195,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_feeds_count":3,"cited_by_msm_count":5,"cited_by_posts_count":265,"cited_by_tweeters_count":257,"cited_by_accounts_count":265,"last_updated":1433354138,"score":242.452,"history":{"1d":9.35,"2d":18.7,"3d":171.3,"4d":171.3,"5d":174,"6d":174,"1w":175,"1m":242.452,"3m":242.452,"6m":242.452,"1y":242.452,"at":242.452},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhv097","added_on":1432232554,"published_on":1432080000,"subjects":["brain"],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine"],"readers":{"citeulike":0,"mendeley":0,"connotea":0},"readers_count":0,"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=243&types=mbtttttt","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=243&types=mbtttttt","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=243&types=mbtttttt"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4038195"},{"title":"The hypoxic cancer secretome induces pre-metastatic bone lesions through lysyl oxidase","doi":"10.1038/nature14492","pmid":"26017313","nlmid":"0410462","tq":["The spread of certain breast cancers to bones can be driven by an enzyme called lysyl oxidase (LOX)","Our latest paper is now online:The hypoxic cancer secretome induces pre-metastatic bone lesions through lysyl oxidase","Novel regulation of #bone #homeostasis and #metastasis revealed in new","Paper from Allie Gartland and Janine Erler's groups in Nature today causing much interest"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003160","issns":["0028-0836","1476-4687"],"journal":"Nature","cohorts":{"pub":57,"com":10,"sci":20,"doc":5},"abstract":"Tumour metastasis is a complex process involving reciprocal interplay between cancer cells and host stroma at both primary and secondary sites, and is strongly influenced by microenvironmental factors such as hypoxia. Tumour-secreted proteins play a crucial role in these interactions and present strategic therapeutic potential. Metastasis of breast cancer to the bone affects approximately 85% of patients with advanced disease and renders them largely untreatable. Specifically, osteolytic bone lesions, where bone is destroyed, lead to debilitating skeletal complications and increased patient morbidity and mortality. The molecular interactions governing the early events of osteolytic lesion formation are currently unclear. Here we show hypoxia to be specifically associated with bone relapse in patients with oestrogen-receptor negative breast cancer. Global quantitative analysis of the hypoxic secretome identified lysyl oxidase (LOX) as significantly associated with bone-tropism and relapse. High expression of LOX in primary breast tumours or systemic delivery of LOX leads to osteolytic lesion formation whereas silencing or inhibition of LOX activity abrogates tumour-driven osteolytic lesion formation. We identify LOX as a novel regulator of NFATc1-driven osteoclastogenesis, independent of RANK ligand, which disrupts normal bone homeostasis leading to the formation of focal pre-metastatic lesions. We show that these lesions subsequently provide a platform for circulating tumour cells to colonize and form bone metastases. Our study identifies a novel mechanism of regulation of bone homeostasis and metastasis, opening up opportunities for novel therapeutic intervention with important clinical implications.","context":{"all":{"count":3835817,"mean":5.0345661538564,"rank":9036,"pct":99,"higher_than":3826987},"journal":{"count":35482,"mean":43.649923451988,"rank":2163,"pct":93,"higher_than":33319},"similar_age_3m":{"count":69295,"mean":7.9390016451641,"rank":406,"pct":99,"higher_than":68888},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":520,"mean":148.69876685934,"rank":143,"pct":72,"higher_than":377}},"altmetric_id":4063912,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Breast cancer","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Bone metastases","scheme":"npg"}],"cited_by_feeds_count":1,"cited_by_gplus_count":4,"cited_by_msm_count":13,"cited_by_posts_count":137,"cited_by_tweeters_count":92,"cited_by_accounts_count":110,"last_updated":1433343531,"score":174.8,"history":{"1d":3.1,"2d":9,"3d":44.75,"4d":45,"5d":50.5,"6d":93.9,"1w":174.8,"1m":174.8,"3m":174.8,"6m":174.8,"1y":174.8,"at":174.8},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature14492","added_on":1432746872,"published_on":1432684800,"subjects":["science"],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"readers":{"citeulike":0,"mendeley":0,"connotea":0},"readers_count":0,"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=175&types=mbtttttg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=175&types=mbtttttg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=175&types=mbtttttg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4063912"},{"title":"Scientific method: Statistical errors","doi":"10.1038/506150a","pmid":"24522584","nlmid":"0410462","tq":["P values, the 'gold standard' of statistical validity, are not as reliable as many scientists assume.","“The wake-up call is that so many of our published findings are not true.”","Why P-values can't tell you if your hypothesis is correct.

forward engineering of genetic circuitry in living cells has positioned synthetic biology as a potential means to solve numerous biomedical problems, including disease diagnosis and therapy. One challenge in exploiting synthetic biology for translational applications is to engineer microbes that are well tolerated by patients and seamlessly integrate with existing clinical methods. We use the safe and widely used probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 to develop an orally administered diagnostic that can noninvasively indicate the presence of liver metastasis by producing easily detectable signals in urine. Our microbial diagnostic generated a high-contrast urine signal through selective expansion in liver metastases (10(6)-fold enrichment) and high expression of a lacZ reporter maintained by engineering a stable plasmid system. The lacZ reporter cleaves a substrate to produce a small molecule that can be detected in urine. E. coli Nissle 1917 robustly colonized tumor tissue in rodent models of liver metastasis after oral delivery but did not colonize healthy organs or fibrotic liver tissue. We saw no deleterious health effects on the mice for more than 12 months after oral delivery. Our results demonstrate that probiotics can be programmed to safely and selectively deliver synthetic gene circuits to diseased tissue microenvironments in vivo.","context":{"all":{"count":3837088,"mean":5.0354099435381,"rank":7798,"pct":99,"higher_than":3829312},"journal":{"count":1596,"mean":32.087603761755,"rank":54,"pct":96,"higher_than":1542},"similar_age_3m":{"count":69674,"mean":7.9448526114851,"rank":363,"pct":99,"higher_than":69311},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":66,"mean":42.541076923077,"rank":5,"pct":92,"higher_than":61}},"altmetric_id":4064315,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":1,"cited_by_feeds_count":2,"cited_by_msm_count":14,"cited_by_posts_count":117,"cited_by_tweeters_count":97,"cited_by_accounts_count":114,"last_updated":1433358489,"score":190.96,"history":{"1d":5.05,"2d":6.05,"3d":7.05,"4d":8.65,"5d":17.85,"6d":54.78,"1w":163.96,"1m":190.96,"3m":190.96,"6m":190.96,"1y":190.96,"at":190.96},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aaa3519","added_on":1432753889,"published_on":1432684800,"subjects":["science","medicine"],"scopus_subjects":[],"readers":{"citeulike":1,"mendeley":0,"connotea":0},"readers_count":1,"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=191&types=mbtttttf","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=191&types=mbtttttf","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=191&types=mbtttttf"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4064315"},{"title":"Tracing the Route of Modern Humans out of Africa by Using 225 Human Genome Sequences from Ethiopians and Egyptians","doi":"10.1016/j.ajhg.2015.04.019","pmid":"26027499","nlmid":"0370475","tq":["Tracing the Route of Modern Humans out of Africa : The American Journal of Human Genetics","Estimación de la ruta que siguieron los humanos modernos para salir de África, mediante la genómica.","Early modern humans migrated along a predominant northern route out of Africa via Egypt","Human #genome sequences from modern Ethiopians and Egyptians suggest ancient northern migration routes"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021ff","issns":["0002-9297","00029297","1537-6605"],"journal":"American Journal of Human Genetics","cohorts":{"com":2,"pub":76,"sci":29,"doc":2},"abstract":"The predominantly African origin of all modern human populations is well established, but the route taken out of Africa is still unclear. Two alternative routes, via Egypt and Sinai or across the Bab el Mandeb strait into Arabia, have traditionally been proposed as feasible gateways in light of geographic, paleoclimatic, archaeological, and genetic evidence. Distinguishing among these alternatives has been difficult. We generated 225 whole-genome sequences (225 at 8× depth, of which 8 were increased to 30×; Illumina HiSeq 2000) from six modern Northeast African populations (100 Egyptians and five Ethiopian populations each represented by 25 individuals). West Eurasian components were masked out, and the remaining African haplotypes were compared with a panel of sub-Saharan African and non-African genomes. We showed that masked Northeast African haplotypes overall were more similar to non-African haplotypes and more frequently present outside Africa than were any sets of haplotypes derived from a West African population. Furthermore, the masked Egyptian haplotypes showed these properties more markedly than the masked Ethiopian haplotypes, pointing to Egypt as the more likely gateway in the exodus to the rest of the world. Using five Ethiopian and three Egyptian high-coverage masked genomes and the multiple sequentially Markovian coalescent (MSMC) approach, we estimated the genetic split times of Egyptians and Ethiopians from non-African populations at 55,000 and 65,000 years ago, respectively, whereas that of West Africans was estimated to be 75,000 years ago.

Leukemia accounts for about 30% of all childhood cancer but its etiology is still mostly unknown.\nTo conduct a meta-analysis of available scientific evidence on the association between breastfeeding and childhood leukemia.\nA thorough search for articles published between January 1960 and December 2014 researching the association between breastfeeding and childhood leukemia was conducted on PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Scopus (performed in July and December 2014), supplemented by manual searches of reference lists.\nTo be included in the meta-analyses, studies had to be case control; include breastfeeding as a measured exposure and leukemia as a measured outcome; include data on breastfeeding duration in months; and be published in a peer-reviewed journal with full text available in English.\nThe search identified 25 relevant studies, 18 of which met all inclusion criteria. No publication bias or heterogeneity among these 18 studies were detected. The quality of each study that met the inclusion criteria was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Multiple meta-analyses were conducted using the random effect model on raw data in the StatsDirect statistical program.\nNo or short duration of breastfeeding and the incidence of childhood leukemia.\nThe meta-analysis of all 18 studies indicated that compared with no or shorter breastfeeding, any breastfeeding for 6 months or longer was associated with a 19% lower risk for childhood leukemia (odds ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.73-0.89). A separate meta-analysis of 15 studies indicated that ever breastfed compared with never breastfed was associated with an 11% lower risk for childhood leukemia (odds ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.84-0.94), although the definition of never breastfed differed between studies. All meta-analyses of subgroups of the 18 studies showed similar associations. Based on current meta-analyses results, 14% to 19% of all childhood leukemia cases may be prevented by breastfeeding for 6 months or more.\nBreastfeeding is a highly accessible, low-cost public health measure. This meta-analysis that included studies not featured in previous meta-analyses on the subject indicates that promoting breastfeeding for 6 months or more may help lower childhood leukemia incidence, in addition to its other health benefits for children and mothers.","context":{"all":{"count":3836919,"mean":5.0351600070736,"rank":11139,"pct":99,"higher_than":3825900},"journal":{"count":719,"mean":36.382259052925,"rank":39,"pct":94,"higher_than":680},"similar_age_3m":{"count":63859,"mean":7.6940734128848,"rank":424,"pct":99,"higher_than":63435},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":33,"mean":46.407875,"rank":5,"pct":84,"higher_than":28}},"altmetric_id":4078171,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"cited_by_feeds_count":2,"cited_by_msm_count":10,"cited_by_posts_count":107,"cited_by_tweeters_count":83,"cited_by_accounts_count":95,"last_updated":1433356981,"score":153.78,"history":{"1d":41.1,"2d":128.98,"3d":153.78,"4d":153.78,"5d":153.78,"6d":153.78,"1w":153.78,"1m":153.78,"3m":153.78,"6m":153.78,"1y":153.78,"at":153.78},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.1025","added_on":1433172009,"published_on":1433282428,"subjects":[],"scopus_subjects":[],"readers":{"citeulike":0,"mendeley":0,"connotea":0},"readers_count":0,"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=154&types=mbtttttt","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=154&types=mbtttttt","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=154&types=mbtttttt"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4078171"},{"title":"Is measles next?","doi":"10.1126/science.348.6238.958","pmid":"26023116","nlmid":"0404511","tq":["Is the world ready to eradicate measles?","Learn more about why #measles can should be stopped - and why that isn't easy in #immunizeEurope","With polio on its way out, could #measles be next?

However, several hurdles have limited whole-cell biosensor application in the clinic, primarily their unreliable operation in complex media and low signal-to-noise ratio. We report that bacterial biosensors with genetically encoded digital amplifying genetic switches can detect clinically relevant biomarkers in human urine and serum. These bactosensors perform signal digitization and amplification, multiplexed signal processing with the use of Boolean logic gates, and data storage. In addition, we provide a framework with which to quantify whole-cell biosensor robustness in clinical samples together with a method for easily reprogramming the sensor module for distinct medical detection agendas. Last, we demonstrate that bactosensors can be used to detect pathological glycosuria in urine from diabetic patients. These next-generation whole-cell biosensors with improved computing and amplification capacity could meet clinical requirements and should enable new approaches for medical diagnosis.","context":{"all":{"count":3836349,"mean":5.0349038199926,"rank":11412,"pct":99,"higher_than":3824990},"journal":{"count":1590,"mean":32.072872246696,"rank":69,"pct":95,"higher_than":1521},"similar_age_3m":{"count":69399,"mean":7.9442009568,"rank":494,"pct":99,"higher_than":68905},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":60,"mean":46.249084745763,"rank":6,"pct":90,"higher_than":54}},"altmetric_id":4064316,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_feeds_count":2,"cited_by_msm_count":13,"cited_by_posts_count":67,"cited_by_tweeters_count":49,"cited_by_accounts_count":64,"last_updated":1433347640,"score":151.434,"history":{"1d":13.05,"2d":20.05,"3d":22.75,"4d":28.054,"5d":31.904,"6d":72.554,"1w":151.434,"1m":151.434,"3m":151.434,"6m":151.434,"1y":151.434,"at":151.434},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aaa3601","added_on":1432753892,"published_on":1432684800,"subjects":["science","medicine"],"scopus_subjects":[],"readers":{"citeulike":1,"mendeley":0,"connotea":0},"readers_count":1,"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=152&types=mbtttttt","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=152&types=mbtttttt","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=152&types=mbtttttt"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4064316"},{"title":"Direct Imaging and Spectroscopy of a Young Extrasolar Kuiper Belt in the\n\n  Nearest OB Association","arxiv_id":"1505.06734","tq":["Just published!

Prominently, this is manifested in the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) in sea surface temperatures. Positive (negative) phases of the AMO coincide with warmer (colder) North Atlantic sea surface temperatures. The AMO is linked with decadal climate fluctuations, such as Indian and Sahel rainfall, European summer precipitation, Atlantic hurricanes and variations in global temperatures. It is widely believed that ocean circulation drives the phase changes of the AMO by controlling ocean heat content. However, there are no direct observations of ocean circulation of sufficient length to support this, leading to questions about whether the AMO is controlled from another source. Here we provide observational evidence of the widely hypothesized link between ocean circulation and the AMO. We take a new approach, using sea level along the east coast of the United States to estimate ocean circulation on decadal timescales. We show that ocean circulation responds to the first mode of Atlantic atmospheric forcing, the North Atlantic Oscillation, through circulation changes between the subtropical and subpolar gyres--the intergyre region. These circulation changes affect the decadal evolution of North Atlantic heat content and, consequently, the phases of the AMO. The Atlantic overturning circulation is declining and the AMO is moving to a negative phase. This may offer a brief respite from the persistent rise of global temperatures, but in the coupled system we describe, there are compensating effects. In this case, the negative AMO is associated with a continued acceleration of sea-level rise along the northeast coast of the United States.","context":{"all":{"count":3836919,"mean":5.0351600070736,"rank":11708,"pct":99,"higher_than":3825243},"journal":{"count":35516,"mean":43.618212586231,"rank":2600,"pct":92,"higher_than":32916},"similar_age_3m":{"count":69592,"mean":7.9439896825739,"rank":503,"pct":99,"higher_than":69089},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":550,"mean":141.09503460838,"rank":158,"pct":71,"higher_than":392}},"altmetric_id":4063927,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Physical oceanography","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Climate-change impacts","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Climate sciences","scheme":"npg"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":1,"cited_by_feeds_count":5,"cited_by_gplus_count":2,"cited_by_msm_count":9,"cited_by_posts_count":102,"cited_by_tweeters_count":74,"cited_by_accounts_count":91,"last_updated":1433354951,"score":148.846,"history":{"1d":2.85,"2d":8.85,"3d":18.35,"4d":40.35,"5d":53.182,"6d":88.254,"1w":143.096,"1m":148.846,"3m":148.846,"6m":148.846,"1y":148.846,"at":148.846},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature14491","added_on":1432747176,"published_on":1432684800,"subjects":["science"],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"readers":{"citeulike":1,"mendeley":0,"connotea":0},"readers_count":1,"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=149&types=mbttttfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=149&types=mbttttfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=149&types=mbttttfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4063927"},{"title":"‘Sleeping beauty’ papers slumber for decades","doi":"10.1038/nature.2015.17615","nlmid":"0410462","tq":["'Sleeping beauty' papers become popular years after publication.

The results, measured by an unrelated panel survey, show that both gay and straight canvassers produced large effects initially, but only gay canvassers' effects persisted in 3-week, 6-week, and 9-month follow-ups. We also find strong evidence of within-household transmission of opinion change, but only in the wake of conversations with gay canvassers. Contact with gay canvassers further caused substantial change in the ratings of gay men and lesbians more generally. These large, persistent, and contagious effects were confirmed by a follow-up experiment. Contact with minorities coupled with discussion of issues pertinent to them is capable of producing a cascade of opinion change.","abstract_source":"pubmed","context":{"all":{"count":3833954,"mean":5.0342846988179,"rank":719,"pct":99,"higher_than":3833104},"journal":{"count":28389,"mean":21.923592193335,"rank":61,"pct":99,"higher_than":28326},"similar_age_3m":{"count":113328,"mean":8.4132174895217,"rank":79,"pct":99,"higher_than":113247},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":479,"mean":95.358682008368,"rank":13,"pct":97,"higher_than":466}},"altmetric_id":2975802,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"cited_by_fbwalls_count":22,"cited_by_feeds_count":22,"cited_by_gplus_count":1,"cited_by_msm_count":32,"cited_by_peer_review_sites_count":1,"cited_by_posts_count":465,"cited_by_rdts_count":1,"cited_by_tweeters_count":319,"cited_by_weibo_count":2,"cited_by_accounts_count":400,"last_updated":1433327822,"score":653.228,"history":{"1d":19.004,"2d":36.854,"3d":46.354,"4d":56.066,"5d":75.042,"6d":126.538,"1w":141.538,"1m":389.924,"3m":407.524,"6m":653.228,"1y":653.228,"at":653.228},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1256151","added_on":1418324994,"published_on":1418342400,"subjects":["science"],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"readers":{"citeulike":0,"mendeley":1,"connotea":0},"readers_count":1,"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=654&types=emsbtrfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=654&types=emsbtrfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=654&types=emsbtrfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2975802"},{"title":"Hyper-precise atomic clocks face off to redefine time","doi":"10.1038/522016a","tq":["Move over, caesium clock.

The data are from the Monitoring the Future studies of 12th graders (1976-2013), 8th and 10th graders (1991-2013), and the American Freshman survey of entering college students (1966-2014). Although the majority of adolescents and emerging adults are still religiously involved, twice as many 12th graders and college students, and 20%-40% more 8th and 10th graders, never attend religious services. Twice as many 12th graders and entering college students in the 2010s (vs. the 1960s-70s) give their religious affiliation as \"none,\" as do 40%-50% more 8th and 10th graders. Recent birth cohorts report less approval of religious organizations, are less likely to say that religion is important in their lives, report being less spiritual, and spend less time praying or meditating. Thus, declines in religious orientation reach beyond affiliation to religious participation and religiosity, suggesting a movement toward secularism among a growing minority. The declines are larger among girls, Whites, lower-SES individuals, and in the Northeastern U.S., very small among Blacks, and non-existent among political conservatives.

A popular but unconfirmed hypothesis to explain how the plasma is energized is the 'internal shock model', in which the relativistic flow is unsteady. Faster components in the jet catch up to and collide with slower ones, leading to internal shocks that accelerate particles and generate magnetic fields. This mechanism can explain the variable, high-energy emission from a diverse set of objects, with the best indirect evidence being the unseen fast relativistic flow inferred to energize slower components in X-ray binary jets. Mapping of the kinematic profiles in resolved jets has revealed precessing and helical patterns in X-ray binaries, apparent superluminal motions, and the ejection of knots (bright components) from standing shocks in the jets of active galaxies. Observations revealing the structure and evolution of an internal shock in action have, however, remained elusive, hindering measurement of the physical parameters and ultimate efficiency of the mechanism. Here we report observations of a collision between two knots in the jet of nearby radio galaxy 3C 264. A bright knot with an apparent speed of (7.0 ± 0.8)c, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum, is in the incipient stages of a collision with a slower-moving knot of speed (1.8 ± 0.5)c just downstream, resulting in brightening of both knots--as seen in the most recent epoch of imaging.","context":{"all":{"count":3828201,"mean":5.0300880305491,"rank":14432,"pct":99,"higher_than":3814583},"journal":{"count":35460,"mean":43.652998843735,"rank":2965,"pct":91,"higher_than":32495},"similar_age_3m":{"count":66459,"mean":8.0230360238353,"rank":588,"pct":99,"higher_than":65867},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":519,"mean":149.24290733591,"rank":173,"pct":66,"higher_than":346}},"altmetric_id":4063971,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Galaxies and clusters","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"High-energy astrophysics","scheme":"npg"}],"cited_by_feeds_count":3,"cited_by_gplus_count":3,"cited_by_msm_count":13,"cited_by_posts_count":37,"cited_by_tweeters_count":17,"cited_by_accounts_count":36,"last_updated":1433258549,"score":128.978,"history":{"1d":7,"2d":10,"3d":10,"4d":11,"5d":65.58,"6d":121.728,"1w":128.978,"1m":128.978,"3m":128.978,"6m":128.978,"1y":128.978,"at":128.978},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature14481","added_on":1432747751,"published_on":1432684800,"subjects":["science"],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"readers":{"citeulike":0,"mendeley":0,"connotea":0},"readers_count":0,"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=129&types=mmmbtttg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=129&types=mmmbtttg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=129&types=mmmbtttg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4063971"},{"title":"Effect of Delayed Cord Clamping on Neurodevelopment at 4 Years of Age: A Randomized Clinical Trial","doi":"10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.0358","pmid":"26010418","nlmid":"101589544","tq":["Extra blood to newborn by late umbilical clamping yields better development at age 4 even in a high income country","Delayed #UmbilicalCord clamping assoc'd w/ better fine-motor social skills,especially boys.","Delayed Clamping and Neurodevelopment at 4 Years of Age.","Link to #delayed #cord clamping study featured"],"altmetric_jid":"53bd372b2a83eef6128b456c","issns":["2168-6211"],"journal":"JAMA Pediatrics","cohorts":{"pub":174,"sci":25,"com":14,"doc":56},"abstract":"Prevention of iron deficiency in infancy may promote neurodevelopment.

Children who were included in the original study (n = 382) as full-term infants born after a low-risk pregnancy were invited to return for follow-up at 4 years of age. Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI-III) and Movement Assessment Battery for Children (Movement ABC) scores (collected between April 18, 2012, and July 5, 2013) were assessed by a blinded psychologist. Between April 11, 2012, and August 13, 2013, parents recorded their child's development using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, Third Edition (ASQ) and behavior using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. All data were analyzed by intention to treat.\nRandomization to delayed CC (≥180 seconds after delivery) or early CC (≤10 seconds after delivery).\nThe main outcome was full-scale IQ as assessed by the WPPSI-III. Secondary objectives were development as assessed by the scales from the WPPSI-III and Movement ABC, development as recorded using the ASQ, and behavior using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire.\nWe assessed 263 children (68.8%).

The ability to reprogram somatic cells into pluripotent cells that can be differentiated in vitro provides a unique opportunity to study normal and abnormal corticogenesis. Here, we present a simple and reproducible 3D culture approach for generating a laminated cerebral cortex-like structure, named human cortical spheroids (hCSs), from pluripotent stem cells. hCSs contain neurons from both deep and superficial cortical layers and map transcriptionally to in vivo fetal development. These neurons are electrophysiologically mature, display spontaneous activity, are surrounded by nonreactive astrocytes and form functional synapses. Experiments in acute hCS slices demonstrate that cortical neurons participate in network activity and produce complex synaptic events. These 3D cultures should allow a detailed interrogation of human cortical development, function and disease, and may prove a versatile platform for generating other neuronal and glial subtypes in vitro.","context":{"all":{"count":3833961,"mean":5.0337173280401,"rank":13212,"pct":99,"higher_than":3820644},"journal":{"count":1941,"mean":14.210292783505,"rank":18,"pct":99,"higher_than":1923},"similar_age_3m":{"count":70791,"mean":7.9707237944531,"rank":572,"pct":99,"higher_than":70206},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":63,"mean":17.598548387097,"rank":1,"pct":98,"higher_than":62}},"altmetric_id":4056705,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Cellular neuroscience","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_feeds_count":5,"cited_by_gplus_count":2,"cited_by_msm_count":11,"cited_by_posts_count":45,"cited_by_tweeters_count":22,"cited_by_accounts_count":40,"last_updated":1433317165,"score":136.77,"history":{"1d":10.25,"2d":30,"3d":78.128,"4d":78.128,"5d":94.17,"6d":124.27,"1w":126.27,"1m":136.77,"3m":136.77,"6m":136.77,"1y":136.77,"at":136.77},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3415","added_on":1432592560,"published_on":1432512000,"subjects":["clinicallaboratorytechniques"],"scopus_subjects":["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Life Sciences"],"readers":{"citeulike":1,"mendeley":0,"connotea":0},"readers_count":1,"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=137&types=mmbttttg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=137&types=mmbttttg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=137&types=mmbttttg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4056705"},{"title":"Experimental evidence of contagious yawning in budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus).","doi":"10.1007/s10071-015-0873-1","pmid":"26012708","nlmid":"9814573","tq":["Contagious yawning in budgies - a sign of empathy?","Experimental evidence of contagious yawning in budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus ) #ornithology #yawn #wildlife","Love it: contagious yawning in budgies","Prepare to yawn!

In Study 1, birds were paired in adjacent cages with and without visual barriers, and the temporal association of yawning was assessed between visual conditions. In Study 2, the same birds were exposed to video stimuli of both conspecific yawns and control behavior, and yawning frequency was compared between conditions. Results from both studies demonstrate that yawning is contagious. To date, this is the first experimental evidence of contagious yawning in a non-mammalian species.

This study was nested within the 6-year follow-up of the Nakuru Eye Disease Cohort in central Kenya and included 300 adults aged 55 years and older recruited consecutively.\nOutcome measures were monocular logMAR visual acuity scores for each test: ETDRS chart logMAR, Snellen acuity, and Peek Acuity. Peek Acuity was compared, in terms of test-retest variability and measurement time, with the Snellen acuity and ETDRS logMAR charts in participants' homes and temporary clinic settings in rural Kenya in 2013 and 2014.\nThe 95% CI limits for test-retest variability of smartphone acuity data were ±0.033 logMAR. The mean differences between the smartphone-based test and the ETDRS chart and the smartphone-based test and Snellen acuity data were 0.07 (95% CI, 0.05-0.09) and 0.08 (95% CI, 0.06-0.10) logMAR, respectively, indicating that smartphone-based test acuities agreed well with those of the ETDRS and Snellen charts. The agreement of Peek Acuity and the ETDRS chart was greater than the Snellen chart with the ETDRS chart (95% CI, 0.05-0.10; P = .08). The local Kenyan community health care workers readily accepted the Peek Acuity smartphone test; it required minimal training and took no longer than the Snellen test (77 seconds vs 82 seconds; 95% CI, 71-84 seconds vs 73-91 seconds, respectively; P = .13).\nThe study demonstrated that the Peek Acuity smartphone test is capable of accurate and repeatable acuity measurements consistent with published data on the test-retest variability of acuities measured using 5-letter-per-line retroilluminated logMAR charts.","context":{"all":{"count":3836046,"mean":5.0347487315766,"rank":15229,"pct":99,"higher_than":3821019},"journal":{"count":882,"mean":5.4976912599319,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":881},"similar_age_3m":{"count":68869,"mean":7.9535884881223,"rank":631,"pct":99,"higher_than":68238},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":40,"mean":4.5551282051282,"rank":1,"pct":97,"higher_than":39}},"altmetric_id":4067617,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"cited_by_feeds_count":3,"cited_by_msm_count":6,"cited_by_posts_count":108,"cited_by_tweeters_count":79,"cited_by_accounts_count":88,"last_updated":1433345772,"score":124.456,"history":{"1d":12.65,"2d":15.75,"3d":47.1,"4d":54.2,"5d":69.406,"6d":107.456,"1w":124.456,"1m":124.456,"3m":124.456,"6m":124.456,"1y":124.456,"at":124.456},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2015.1468","added_on":1432828456,"published_on":1432771200,"subjects":["ophthalmology"],"scopus_subjects":[],"readers":{"citeulike":0,"mendeley":0,"connotea":0},"readers_count":0,"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=125&types=mbtttttt","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=125&types=mbtttttt","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=125&types=mbtttttt"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4067617"},{"title":"Retracted gay-marriage study debated at misconduct meet-up","doi":"10.1038/522014a","tq":["Research misconduct experts discuss lessons to learn from retraction of gay-marriage","LaCour's retracted gay-marriage study discussed by research misconduct experts at #wcri2015","Retracted gay-marriage study debated by research misconduct specialists #wcri2015","Somehow misconduct meetup sounds like a salacious mobile app."],"journal":"Nature News","cohorts":{"pub":105,"com":7,"sci":52,"doc":6},"altmetric_id":4082138,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"cited_by_msm_count":1,"cited_by_posts_count":184,"cited_by_tweeters_count":170,"cited_by_accounts_count":171,"last_updated":1433356435,"score":121.9,"history":{"1d":86.35,"2d":121.9,"3d":121.9,"4d":121.9,"5d":121.9,"6d":121.9,"1w":121.9,"1m":121.9,"3m":121.9,"6m":121.9,"1y":121.9,"at":121.9},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/522014a","added_on":1433256177,"published_on":1433376000,"readers":{"citeulike":0,"mendeley":0,"connotea":0},"readers_count":0,"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=122&types=mttttttt","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=122&types=mttttttt","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=122&types=mttttttt"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4082138"},{"title":"Big compromises needed to meet carbon-emissions goal","doi":"10.1038/521404a","pmid":"26017423","nlmid":"0410462","tq":["Current climate pledges wld bring 3 °C rise by 2100.

Surveys of DNA methylation in human tissues have established a complex landscape including both tissue-specific and invariant methylation patterns. Here we report high coverage methylomes that catalogue cytosine methylation in all contexts for the major human organ systems, integrated with matched transcriptomes and genomic sequence. By combining these diverse data types with each individuals' phased genome, we identified widespread tissue-specific differential CG methylation (mCG), partially methylated domains, allele-specific methylation and transcription, and the unexpected presence of non-CG methylation (mCH) in almost all human tissues. mCH correlated with tissue-specific functions, and using this mark, we made novel predictions of genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation in specific tissues. Overall, DNA methylation in several genomic contexts varies substantially among human tissues.","context":{"all":{"count":3836919,"mean":5.0351600070736,"rank":18251,"pct":99,"higher_than":3818801},"journal":{"count":35516,"mean":43.618212586231,"rank":3485,"pct":90,"higher_than":32033},"similar_age_3m":{"count":63866,"mean":7.6957903076802,"rank":656,"pct":98,"higher_than":63210},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":491,"mean":142.63076326531,"rank":169,"pct":65,"higher_than":322}},"altmetric_id":4078149,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Epigenomics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"DNA methylation","scheme":"npg"}],"cited_by_feeds_count":1,"cited_by_gplus_count":1,"cited_by_msm_count":5,"cited_by_posts_count":123,"cited_by_tweeters_count":111,"cited_by_accounts_count":118,"last_updated":1433357239,"score":110.526,"history":{"1d":20.65,"2d":48.85,"3d":110.526,"4d":110.526,"5d":110.526,"6d":110.526,"1w":110.526,"1m":110.526,"3m":110.526,"6m":110.526,"1y":110.526,"at":110.526},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature14465","added_on":1433171636,"published_on":1433116800,"subjects":["science"],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"readers":{"citeulike":0,"mendeley":0,"connotea":0},"readers_count":0,"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=111&types=mbtttttg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=111&types=mbtttttg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=111&types=mbtttttg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4078149"},{"title":"Exposure to traffic noise and markers of obesity.","doi":"10.1136/oemed-2014-102516","pmid":"26009579","nlmid":"9422759","tq":["New research: Exposure to traffic noise and markers of obesity #obesity @karolinskainst","NHS Choices: as ever, good appraisal of research news - from paper","Noise pollution and obesity linked - further support for noise toxicology rating #benjaminfenech #PHE","the traffic noise - obesity study is #openaccess"],"altmetric_jid":"52b2ceaa3cf058a06b8b4568","issns":["1470-7926","1351-0711"],"journal":"Occupational and environmental medicine","cohorts":{"pub":64,"doc":6,"com":4,"sci":5},"abstract":"Limited evidence suggests adverse effects of traffic noise exposure on the metabolic system. This study investigates the association between road traffic noise and obesity markers as well as the role of combined exposure to multiple sources of traffic noise.\nIn a cross-sectional study performed in 2002-2006, we assessed exposure to noise from road traffic, railways and aircraft at the residences of 5075 Swedish men and women, primarily from suburban and semirural areas of Stockholm County. A detailed questionnaire and medical examination provided information on markers of obesity and potential confounders. Multiple linear and logistic regression models were used to assess associations between traffic noise and body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and waist-hip ratio using WHO definitions of obesity.\nRoad traffic noise was significantly related to waist circumference with a 0.21 cm (95% CI 0.01 to 0.41) increase per 5 dB(A) rise in Lden. The OR for central obesity among those exposed to road traffic noise ≥45 dB(A) was 1.18 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.34) in comparison to those exposed below this level. Similar results were seen for waist-hip ratio (OR 1.29; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.45) but not for BMI (OR 0.89; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.04). Central obesity was also associated with exposure to railway and aircraft noise, and a particularly high risk was seen for combined exposure to all three sources of traffic noise (OR 1.95; 95% CI 1.24 to 3.05).\nOur results suggest that traffic noise exposure can increase the risk of central obesity.

Overall, 7630 infants not exposed to antidepressants were diagnosed with PPHN (20.8; 95% CI, 20.4-21.3 per 10 000 births) compared with 322 infants exposed to SSRIs (31.5; 95% CI, 28.3-35.2 per 10 000 births), and 78 infants exposed to non-SSRIs (29.1; 95% CI, 23.3-36.4 per 10 000 births). Associations between antidepressant use and PPHN were attenuated with increasing levels of confounding adjustment. For SSRIs, odds ratios were 1.51 (95% CI, 1.35-1.69) unadjusted and 1.10 (95% CI, 0.94-1.29) after restricting to women with depression and adjusting for the high-dimensional propensity score. For non-SSRIs, the odds ratios were 1.40 (95% CI, 1.12-1.75) and 1.02 (95% CI, 0.77-1.35), respectively. Upon restriction of the outcome to primary PPHN, the adjusted odds ratio for SSRIs was 1.28 (95% CI, 1.01-1.64) and for non-SSRIs 1.14 (95% CI, 0.74-1.74).\nEvidence from this large study of publicly insured pregnant women may be consistent with a potential increased risk of PPHN associated with maternal use of SSRIs in late pregnancy. However, the absolute risk was small, and the risk increase appears more modest than suggested in previous studies.","context":{"all":{"count":3837088,"mean":5.0354099435381,"rank":20003,"pct":99,"higher_than":3817113},"journal":{"count":10636,"mean":21.454587494123,"rank":481,"pct":95,"higher_than":10156},"similar_age_3m":{"count":62285,"mean":7.6764538244171,"rank":695,"pct":98,"higher_than":61590},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":215,"mean":57.654878504673,"rank":24,"pct":88,"higher_than":191}},"altmetric_id":4082489,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_msm_count":6,"cited_by_posts_count":122,"cited_by_tweeters_count":98,"cited_by_accounts_count":104,"last_updated":1433358771,"score":103.9,"history":{"1d":78.4,"2d":103.9,"3d":103.9,"4d":103.9,"5d":103.9,"6d":103.9,"1w":103.9,"1m":103.9,"3m":103.9,"6m":103.9,"1y":103.9,"at":103.9},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2015.5605","added_on":1433262139,"published_on":1433327522,"subjects":["medicine"],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine"],"readers":{"citeulike":0,"mendeley":1,"connotea":0},"readers_count":1,"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=104&types=mttttttt","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=104&types=mttttttt","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=104&types=mttttttt"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4082489"},{"title":"Researchers argue for standard format to cite lab resources","doi":"10.1038/nature.2015.17652","nlmid":"0410462","tq":["Could a standard format for citing lab resources clean up poorly referenced data?","Researchers argue for standard format to cite lab resources, the Research Resource Identifier, RRID #openscience","How bad are methods in your journal?

Although evidence suggests important early-life health benefits of smoke-free public environments, the impact on childhood RTIs is unclear. We investigated the association between England's smoke-free legislation and childhood RTI hospitalisations. We used the Hospital Episode Statistics database to obtain nationwide data on hospital admissions for acute RTIs among children (<15 years of age) from 2001 to 2012. Hospitalisation counts were disaggregated by month, age group, sex and small-area level, and linked to urbanisation, region, deprivation index and corresponding population estimates. Negative binomial regression analyses were adjusted for confounders, seasonal variation, temporal autocorrelation, population-size changes and underlying incidence trends. Models allowed for sudden and gradual changes following the smoke-free legislation. We performed sensitivity and subgroup analyses, and estimated number of events prevented. We analysed 1 651 675 hospital admissions. Introduction of smoke-free legislation was followed by an immediate reduction in RTI admissions (-3.5%, 95% CI -4.7- -2.3%), this mainly being attributable to a decrease in lower RTI admissions (-13.8%, 95% CI -15.6- -12.0%). The reductions in admissions for upper RTI were more incremental.

Its citation history exhibits a long hibernation period followed by a sudden spike of popularity. Previous studies suggest a relative scarcity of SBs. The reliability of this conclusion is, however, heavily dependent on identification methods based on arbitrary threshold parameters for sleeping time and number of citations, applied to small or monodisciplinary bibliographic datasets. Here we present a systematic, large-scale, and multidisciplinary analysis of the SB phenomenon in science. We introduce a parameter-free measure that quantifies the extent to which a specific paper can be considered an SB. We apply our method to 22 million scientific papers published in all disciplines of natural and social sciences over a time span longer than a century. Our results reveal that the SB phenomenon is not exceptional. There is a continuous spectrum of delayed recognition where both the hibernation period and the awakening intensity are taken into account. Although many cases of SBs can be identified by looking at monodisciplinary bibliographic data, the SB phenomenon becomes much more apparent with the analysis of multidisciplinary datasets, where we can observe many examples of papers achieving delayed yet exceptional importance in disciplines different from those where they were originally published. Our analysis emphasizes a complex feature of citation dynamics that so far has received little attention, and also provides empirical evidence against the use of short-term citation metrics in the quantification of scientific impact.","context":{"all":{"count":3836919,"mean":5.0351600070736,"rank":9622,"pct":99,"higher_than":3827307},"journal":{"count":34471,"mean":14.051831563679,"rank":451,"pct":98,"higher_than":34020},"similar_age_3m":{"count":70327,"mean":7.9659418991554,"rank":434,"pct":99,"higher_than":69893},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":601,"mean":21.678606666667,"rank":10,"pct":98,"higher_than":591}},"altmetric_id":4059565,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_feeds_count":4,"cited_by_msm_count":5,"cited_by_posts_count":171,"cited_by_tweeters_count":158,"cited_by_accounts_count":167,"last_updated":1433354651,"score":168.228,"history":{"1d":4.25,"2d":23,"3d":29.85,"4d":45.3,"5d":53.74,"6d":69.298,"1w":101.328,"1m":168.228,"3m":168.228,"6m":168.228,"1y":168.228,"at":168.228},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1424329112","added_on":1432660046,"published_on":1432598400,"subjects":["science"],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"readers":{"citeulike":0,"mendeley":1,"connotea":0},"readers_count":1,"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=169&types=mbtttttt","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=169&types=mbtttttt","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=169&types=mbtttttt"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4059565"},{"title":"In

adults commenced in the spring of 2014. The search for psychotherapeutic options for autistic individuals is imperative considering the lack of effective conventional treatments for mental health diagnoses that are common in this population. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) involving administration of MDMA in clinical trials have been rare and non-life threatening. To date, MDMA has been administered to over 1133 individuals for research purposes without the occurrence of unexpected drug-related SAEs that require expedited reporting per FDA regulations. Now that safety parameters for limited use of MDMA in clinical settings have been established, a case can be made to further develop MDMA-assisted therapeutic interventions that could support autistic adults in increasing social adaptability among the typically developing population. As in the case with classic hallucinogens and other psychedelic drugs, MDMA catalyzes shifts towards openness and introspection that do not require ongoing administration to achieve lasting benefits. This infrequent dosing mitigates adverse event frequency and improves the risk/benefit ratio of MDMA, which may provide a significant advantage over medications that require daily dosing. Consequently, clinicians could employ new treatment models for social anxiety or similar types of distress administering MDMA on one to several occasions within the context of a supportive and integrative psychotherapy protocol.\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02008396.","context":{"all":{"count":3833961,"mean":5.0337173280401,"rank":4343,"pct":99,"higher_than":3829514},"journal":{"count":715,"mean":3.1978067226891,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":714},"similar_age_3m":{"count":113735,"mean":9.8827856043757,"rank":508,"pct":99,"higher_than":113222},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":20,"mean":2.6210526315789,"rank":1,"pct":95,"higher_than":19}},"altmetric_id":3839816,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"cited_by_fbwalls_count":13,"cited_by_feeds_count":3,"cited_by_gplus_count":1,"cited_by_msm_count":15,"cited_by_posts_count":216,"cited_by_rdts_count":2,"cited_by_tweeters_count":162,"cited_by_wikipedia_count":1,"cited_by_accounts_count":197,"last_updated":1433251614,"score":270.308,"history":{"1d":0.5,"2d":0.5,"3d":1.85,"4d":13.7,"5d":23.8,"6d":79.25,"1w":97.85,"1m":177.308,"3m":270.308,"6m":270.308,"1y":270.308,"at":270.308},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2015.03.011","added_on":1427358459,"published_on":1427839463,"subjects":[],"scopus_subjects":["Neuroscience","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Life Sciences"],"readers":{"citeulike":0,"mendeley":0,"connotea":0},"readers_count":0,"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=271&types=mbttwrfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=271&types=mbttwrfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=271&types=mbttwrfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=3839816"},{"title":"Hemispheric specialization for visual words is shaped by attention to sublexical units during initial learning.","doi":"10.1016/j.bandl.2015.04.001","pmid":"25935827","nlmid":"7506220","tq":["Apprendre à lire: il est crucial d'orienter l'attention sur les correspondances lettres-sons.","The importance of sound-letter mapping in learning to read.","Enseignement de la lecture: effets sur le cerveau de différentes approches pédagogiques utilisant le même matériel","@C_Hendrick here's the paper"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f610002426","issns":["1090-2155","0093934X"],"journal":"Brain & Language","cohorts":{"pub":47,"sci":2,"doc":1},"abstract":"Selective attention to grapheme-phoneme mappings during learning can impact the circuitry subsequently recruited during reading. Here we trained literate adults to read two novel scripts of glyph words containing embedded letters under different instructions. For one script, learners linked each embedded letter to its corresponding sound within the word (grapheme-phoneme focus); for the other, decoding was prevented so entire words had to be memorized. Post-training, ERPs were recorded during a reading task on the trained words within each condition and on untrained but decodable (transfer) words. Within this condition, reaction-time patterns suggested both trained and transfer words were accessed via sublexical units, yet a left-lateralized, late ERP response showed an enhanced left lateralization for transfer words relative to trained words, potentially reflecting effortful decoding. Collectively, these findings show that selective attention to grapheme-phoneme mappings during learning drives the lateralization of circuitry that supports later word recognition. This study thus provides a model example of how different instructional approaches to the same material may impact changes in brain circuitry.","context":{"all":{"count":3836919,"mean":5.0351600070736,"rank":21853,"pct":99,"higher_than":3815175},"journal":{"count":387,"mean":4.8723678756477,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":386},"similar_age_3m":{"count":69143,"mean":7.9573535333083,"rank":893,"pct":98,"higher_than":68250},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":5,"mean":3.85,"rank":1,"pct":80,"higher_than":4}},"altmetric_id":4068449,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Language, Communication And Culture","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":1,"cited_by_feeds_count":2,"cited_by_msm_count":6,"cited_by_posts_count":61,"cited_by_tweeters_count":50,"cited_by_accounts_count":59,"last_updated":1433356200,"score":97.832,"history":{"1d":15.85,"2d":25.55,"3d":31.6,"4d":34.4,"5d":60.6,"6d":89.6,"1w":97.832,"1m":97.832,"3m":97.832,"6m":97.832,"1y":97.832,"at":97.832},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bandl.2015.04.001","added_on":1432848228,"subjects":["brain","speechlanguagepathology","psychophysiology"],"scopus_subjects":["Neuroscience","Social Sciences","Psychology","Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Health Professions"],"readers":{"citeulike":0,"mendeley":0,"connotea":0},"readers_count":0,"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=98&types=mbtttttf","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=98&types=mbtttttf","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=98&types=mbtttttf"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=4068449"}]}
